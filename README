Hi,

The goal of this project is to create a RFC 2338 VRRP Daemon compliant. For this time, the most important work was done. See TODO list for the rest of the work.
There is one thing that I can't do in FreeBSD, defining multiple real interface device for one physical network interface. So I can't set multiple lladdr for one interface (as we can do with IP addresses), then on the beginning I have decided to create a list of lladdr and set the last master lladdr RFC2338 (00:5E:00...) and restore lladdr with this list.
But, there is a lot of ARP cache update and it's not very good, so for conforming to the RFC, I decide to remove list of lladdr and just set 00:5E:00... MAC addresses when I send VRRP packets. Receiving of VRRP packets is not a problem because I use BPF device driver and the destination address of this packet is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.
If you have specific questions, I can respond by mail at spe@bsdfr.org
